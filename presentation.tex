        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Active travel policies frame walking \& cycling as `good', cars as `bad'!
                \item Perceptions of acceptable commute method vary by groups.
                \item Beliefs may explain this difference.
                \item Beliefs spread through social networks.
            \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Research questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What are the beliefs and attitudes required to create a calibrated model of active travel?
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Answered by a systematic review of the literature.
              \end{itemize}
        \item What network-based interventions may be effective in increasing active travel levels?
        \item How may non-network-based interventions cause an additional network-based effect
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Elements of the model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Beliefs}: These are `attitudes towards some proposition'.
        \item \emph{Behaviours}: These are actions an agent can perform.
        \item \emph{Agents}: These are people (in this model).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Agents hold beliefs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agents hold beliefs either positively or negatively (i.e., they are averse to the belief).
        \item For example, John may believe that cycling to work makes you look cool; Alex might be averse to that view.
        \item This strength of feeling is called \emph{activation}.
        \item It is a numerical value in the range \([-1,+1]\).
        \item This determines the behaviour agents perform; however, this is out-of-scope for this model as there already exist good models for this (\emph{BDI}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Next steps}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Run this model many times. Do the results make sense?
        \item Implement some interventions. What are there results?
        \item What do the results mean for public health policy / planning policy?
        \item Is there any `low-hanging fruit'?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
